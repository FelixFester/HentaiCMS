# whoa, look at this shit! 

## yes! Another fucking page that works!

You can even go to main page [like this](index.php)! Isn't that cool?

Just don't forget to add links like that `index.php?page=YOUR PAGE FILE NAME IN content/ FOLDER WITHOUT .md`. Or, if your .md file located in **content/** inside folder, you can do for example `index.php?page=aboutme/games` where "aboutme" is name of folder and "games" is a name of file "games.md". Another ways of opening pages that was used before might not work. 

Feeling creative? Add your own theme in folder `themes`! You can use [settings.php](settings.php) to switch between them!

If you using Hentai CMS on certain hosting on nginx without access to configuration, you still will have 404 error when someone tries to open page through index.php. Also you can add index.php with JavaScript redirection to main page in folders to secure them on such nginx servers as well, if your hosting have such thing when without index.php it directly listing all files in folder so anyone can peek inside your website.
